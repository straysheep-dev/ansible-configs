install-unbound
=========

This role installs the unboud DNS resolver with a hardened configuration file based on pfSense's defaults. It also enables DNS logging along with DNS over TLS to cloudflare and quad9 by default.

You can follow logs with `tail` on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep 'unbound'
```

On systems without `/var/log/syslog`, like Kali, you can follow unbound logs with `journalctl`:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u unbound -f
```

With the default apparmor profiles applied in both Ubuntu and Kali, you cannot change the logging destination to a file.

If apparmor is not enabled for unbound, you can change the following lines in `unbound.conf` to write logs to a file path:

```conf
	use-syslog: no
	logfile: "/var/log/unbound.log"
```

Then create the logfile:

```bash
sudo touch /var/log/unbound.log
sudo chown unbound:unbound /var/log/unbound.log
```

Finally restarting unbound:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart unbound
```
