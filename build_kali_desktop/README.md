build_kali_desktop
=========

Deploy a customizable desktop environment for [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/).

This is meant to manage all things specific to Kali without getting in the way of more common system settings and services. Things such as DNS, logging, additional hardening, HIDS/IPS can (and should) be applied using other roles. For example none of these changes prevent you form telling Kali to use unbound or stubby for DNS over TLS to the public web, or even deploying an EDR agent along with auditd for log and event colleciton.

- Select which tool sets you want specifying the variables in `defaults/main.yml` in your inventory file.
- Handles tools and packages by using a template task file based on the intended usage, choose and manage the tools in `vars/main.yml` ([see below](#role-variables))
  - Tasks pull from sources such as apt, pip, GitHub repos, GitHub release files, and individual URLs
- Enables apparmor (including for Firefox)
- Installs a custom Firefox policy
- Automatically exports and installs the Burpsuite and ZAProxy CA certifactes (learned from [IppSec/parrot-build](https://github.com/IppSec/parrot-build/blob/master/roles/customize-browser/files/getburpcert.sh))
- Enables UFW, allows SSH
- Refreshes the SSH host keys (useful if Kali was pre-installed)
- Adjusts proxychains timeout values for scanning
- Installs [GEF (GDB Enhanced Features)](https://github.com/hugsy/gef)

Requirements
------------

Just Kali Linux. Both real hardware and virtualized environments will work.

Role Variables
--------------

Use `defaults/main.yml` to select tool sets to install. "core" is always present as the base set of packages for general usage.

***Currently only `core`, `pentest`, and `webapp` are ready to use.***

- `core_tools: true` Set to `false` if you don't want the core tools
- `pentest_tools: false` Set to `true` to iunclude pentest tools
- `webapp_tools: false` Set to `true` to iunclude webapp tools
- `wireless_tools: false` Set to `true` to include wireless tools
- `analysis_tools: false` Set to `true` to include analysis tools
- `forensics_tools: false` Set to `true` to include forensics tools
- `development_tools: false` Set to `true` to include development tools

All of the tools and packages are maintained through `vars/main.yml`, and each `tools-*` task file shares the same structure to maintain its own toolset:

- apt packages
- pip / go / ruby / npm packages
- git release files
- git repos to clone
- any other individual files to download
- any additional changes or adjustments specific to this task file

For example, use `tasks/tools-TEMPLATE.yml` to create a `tools-forensics.yml` task file.

`apt_list_REPLACE_THIS` would change to `apt_list_forensics`, and `vars/main.yml` would contain the `apt_list_forensics` variable of apt packages related to forensics.

Populate the remaining areas with any necessary lists; `pip_list_forensics`, `author_repo_list_forensics`, and so on.

Dependencies
------------

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

Running locally (though this role works on remote machines as well):

```yml
- name: "Default Playbook"
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  roles:
    - role: "build_kali_desktop"
```

Execute with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local --ask-become-pass -v ./playbook.yml
```
